## 🚀 How to Use

### Access the Features:

1. **Homepage** - `http://localhost:3000/`
2. **Create Post** - Click the "Create" button in navbar or go to `/create-post`
3. **Communities** - Click "Communities" in navbar or go to `/communities`
4. **Chat** - Click "Chat" in navbar or go to `/chat`
5. **Explore** - Browse all collections at `/explore`

### Testing the Features:

Since MongoDB is not yet configured, the frontend shows **mock data** for demonstration:
- Chat shows 3 sample conversations
- Communities shows 6 sample communities
- Posts show collection items

Once you configure MongoDB (see below), all data will be persisted to the database.

## 🗄️ MongoDB Setup (Required for Backend)

To enable full functionality, you need to set up MongoDB:

### Option 1: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - Recommended)

1. Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a free M0 cluster
4. Create a database user
5. Allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
6. Get your connection string

### Option 2: Local MongoDB

```bash
# Install MongoDB locally
brew install mongodb-community  # macOS
# or
sudo apt install mongodb  # Linux
```

### Configure Environment Variables:

Edit `/server/.env`:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/collectorshub?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_random_string_here_make_it_long
PORT=5001
```

**Replace:**
- `username` - Your MongoDB username
- `password` - Your MongoDB password
- `cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net` - Your cluster address
- `JWT_SECRET` - Any random string (e.g., "my-super-secret-jwt-key-12345")

Once configured, restart the server and it will connect to MongoDB!
